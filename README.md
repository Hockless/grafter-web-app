# Grafter

## A Northcoders student project by James Hockless

Grafter is a mobile app that is designed for people in the trades industry and is used for keeping up to date with your ongoing jobs, as well as planning and preparing new ones.
Personal experience and research suggests that this type of software is in demand, which is why we chose to develop this app. In your jobs list you can upload images of your plans to the job, you can create a list of materials and you can also keep track of the jobs with an inbuilt calendar.
