# Grafter

## A Northcoders student project by James Hockless

Grafter is a mobile app that is designed for people in the trades industry and is used for keeping up to date with your ongoing jobs, as well as planning and preparing new ones.
Personal experience and research suggests that this type of software is in demand, which is why we chose to develop this app. In your jobs list you can upload images of your plans to the job, you can create a list of materials and you can also keep track of the jobs with an inbuilt calendar.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
